/* Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year (year 1) and increases
	5% every year. Write a program that computes the tuition in x years from now, with
	x being a number given by the user. In addition, the program should compute the
	total cost of y yearsâ€™ worth of tuition starting from now, with y being a number given
	by the user. Finally, the program should display the tuition for x years along with the
	total tuition cost at the end of each year. Your program will terminate when the user
	enters 0.
