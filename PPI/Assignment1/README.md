# COMP111 – Programming Principles I
 Programming Assignment 1
 Grade	-	100.00 / 100.0 

## 1. Assignment Objectives
- Gain practical experience with elementary C++ programming features.

## 2. Assignment Description
Your task is to develop programs for the assigned exercises. Your programs should
follow proper formatting guidelines (see sample program on the course site). Lack of
comments and indentation will be penalized.

## 3. Assignment Deliverables and Submission
You need to send the source files (.cpp) of all programs (5 cpp files) and a pdf document
with screenshots of the execution of all programs. You must electronically submit your
source files and pdf document via the course online platform.

## 4. Problems
1. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by
taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters.
Write a program than prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in
inches and display the BMI. Note that 1 pound is 0.45359237 kilogram and 1 inch is
0.0254 meter. Here is a sample run:

```
Enter weight in pounds: 95.5
Enter height in inches: 50
BMI is 26.8573
```

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1 ,y1 ) and (x 2 ,y2 ) and
display their distance. The formula for computing the distance is shown below:

`d=√((x2 – x1)² + (y2 – y1)²).`

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
Enter x2 and y2: 4 5

The distance between the points (1.5,-3.4) and (4,5) is 8.7641
```

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number n and displays n¹ , n² , n³ , n⁴ ,
n⁵ . Here is a sample run:

```
Enter a number: 4

4 raised in the power of 1: 4
4 raised in the power of 2: 16
4 raised in the power of 3: 64
4 raised in the power of 4: 256
4 raised in the power of 5: 1024
```

4. Write a program that prompts the user for a character and displays its ASCII code
as well as the ASCII codes for the next 3 characters. Here is a sample run:

```
Enter a character: A

ASCII code for A is 65
ASCII code for B is 66
ASCII code for C is 67
ASCII code for D is 68
```

5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter an uppercase letter and converts it to
a lowercase letter. Hint: In the ASCII table the uppercase letters appear before the
lowercase letters. The offset between any uppercase letter and its corresponding
lowercase letter is the same. Here is a sample run:

```
Enter an uppercase letter: K
The lowercase letter is k
```
