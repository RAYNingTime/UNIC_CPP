// In this assignment, you must follow the Software Development Cycle (phases 2-5) to design and
// develop a program which calculates the monthly bill for a user subscribed to a fictional movie
// streaming service called MovieFlix based on the number of movies the user has seen. (Essentially
//	document and describe your plan for the exercise)
