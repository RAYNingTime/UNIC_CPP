# Software Development Lab I (COMP-116)
## Homework 4

In this assignment, you must follow the Software Development Cycle (phases 2-5) to design and
develop a program which calculates the monthly bill for a user subscribed to a fictional movie
streaming service called MovieFlix based on the number of movies the user has seen. (Essentially
document and describe your plan for the exercise)

Specifically, the MovieFlix charging policy is the following:
- A fixed monthly subscription of 9.99 euros is always charged even if the user did not use
MovieFlix at all.
- The first 10 movies are free.
- The next 15 movies are provided for 1.5 euros per movie.
- The next 20 movies are provided for 3 euros per movie.
- Afterwards (> 45) movies are provided for 1 euros per movie.

Note: remember that the total movie bill must be presented with only two decimal digits.

Your submission must include both the documentation (in pdf format) and the source code in txt.
