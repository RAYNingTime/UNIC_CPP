# Software Development Lab I (COMP-116)
## Homework 1
1. Develop a program that displays on the console the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle
for different lengths of the other sides of the triangle based on the Pythagorean theorem1 .
Note: do not use libraries or programming techniques that have not been taught yet.
Example:

```
Input the lengths of the sides of a triangle
side A length: 4.0
side B length: 3.0

Based on the Pythagorean theorem, the length of side C is: 5.0
```

___

2. Write a program that asks the user to type 5 doubles and writes the average of the 5
doubles. This program can use only 2 variables.
Example:

```
Give me 5 numbers: 4.1 3.2 6.7 9.9 12.0

The average of these 5 numbers is: 7.18
```

___

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2), and displays the slope of the line that connects the two points. The
formula of the slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).
Example:

```
Enter the coordinates of the first point: 4.5 -5.5
Enter the coordinates of the second point: 6.6 -6.5

The slope of the line connecting (4.5, -5.5) and (6.6, -6.5) is: -0.47619
```
